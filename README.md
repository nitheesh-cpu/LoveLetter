## About this Project

This project is a recreation of the card game _Love Letter_ in Java. The graphical interface was made using Java Swing and was written entirely in Java. Love Letter is a 3-player competitive multiplayer card game in which players take turns picking up and discarding card in attempts to win the love of the princess and reach 5 points first. Each card has a unique ability when discarded to add some strategy to the gameplay and requires a good memory along with skill in social deduction games.
